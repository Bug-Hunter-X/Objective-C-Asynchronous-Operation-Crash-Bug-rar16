This repository demonstrates a common but often overlooked bug in Objective-C related to asynchronous operations and object lifecycles.  The bug occurs when `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` is used without properly managing the object's lifetime. If the object is deallocated before the selector is executed, a crash will result. The solution showcases how to mitigate this issue using techniques such as weak references or blocks that retain the object appropriately.
