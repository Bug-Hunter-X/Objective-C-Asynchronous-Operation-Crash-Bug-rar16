In Objective-C, a rare but impactful bug can arise from the improper use of `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` or similar methods that involve asynchronous operations and object lifecycles.  If the object that's scheduled to perform a selector is deallocated before the delay expires, attempting to execute the selector on a deallocated object will lead to a crash. This is particularly insidious because the crash doesn't occur immediately; it occurs later, after a time delay, potentially making it difficult to debug.
